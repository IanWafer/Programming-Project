    "\n",
    "The porpose of this programming project is to synthesise a dataset that simulates a rea world phenomenon of our choosing. It is recommended we pick something of interest to our personal or professional life and that we use the numpy.random padckage to do so. The selected phenomenon needs to be measureable and for which we could collect at least 100 data points across 4 seperate variables for. We need to investigate the variables involved, their distribution in relation to each other. Synthesise or simulate a data set that closely mathces thir properties and detail all research in a Jupyter notebook."
